Have you run in to the warning message below, and don't know how to fix it?

Warning: Permanently added '192.168.1.1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @

Permissions 0644 for '/path/to/my/key.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
bad permissions: ignore key: /path/to/my/key.pem
Permission denied (publickey).


How can I fix it?
Like I said earlier, this is an easy fix. Just run:

$ sudo chmod 600 /path/to/my/key.pem

Keep in mind that if you keep all of your keys in the ~/.ssh directory (or any other directory, really), you may need to adjust the permissions for that directory as well. In that case, use this:

$ sudo chmod 755 ~/.ssh

And that's all there is to it. Now you should be able to use your key with no problems.
